# Henri K | My Portfolio

![image](/screenshot.png)

Hello world! As a front-end development student, one of my assignments was to create a portfolio website. This is what I came up with.

## Description

French writer Saint-Exup√©ry once wrote that "perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." I love this quote! It is my hope that most of my designs can reflect this idea: I want my projects to convey a sense of minimalism, purposefulness and elegance.
